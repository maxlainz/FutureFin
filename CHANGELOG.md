# Changelog

All notable changes to FutureFin will be documented here.
Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
Versioning follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [1.0.3] — 2026-05-13

### Added
- **Budget — Persiste tras jubilación**: Each income entry now has a "Persists after retirement" toggle (default off). Income items marked as persisting continue to contribute to cash flow after the retirement age; all others stop. This drives a more realistic FIRE projection and a lower FIRE wealth target when passive/pension income is present.
- **Projection engine**: `income_retirement_monthly` field in `ProjectionInput`; simulation loop switches income at `retirement_start_month` instead of keeping it flat for the full horizon. `retirement_monthly_withdrawal` is always 0 — the income drop alone drives the portfolio drain.
- **FIRE target**: Annual need now subtracts persistent retirement income (`max(0, expense − income_retirement) × 12 / SWR` in annual-expense mode; `max(0, income − income_retirement) × 12 / SWR` in current-income mode).
- **Registration**: `birth_date` is now a required field at sign-up (was optional and had to be set separately).
- **Dev workflow**: `docker-compose.local.yml` + CLAUDE.md instructions for full-stack local testing without publishing to Docker Hub.

## [1.0.2] — 2026-05-12

### Fixed
- Docker healthcheck changed from `CMD` (exec form) to `CMD-SHELL` so `curl` resolves correctly via shell PATH; bash `/dev/tcp` fallback for images without `curl`
- `RUST_LOG` added to `docker-compose.yml` so container logs are visible by default

### Improved
- Startup log milestones: version, database connected, migrations applied, server config (port, session TTL, cookie_secure)

## [1.0.1] — 2026-05-12

### Infrastructure
- Single `docker-compose.yml` for production (Docker Hub image, no TLS overlay)
- Only `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` is required; all other vars have sane defaults
- `apps/api/Dockerfile` runtime stage now includes `curl` (required for healthcheck)
- Dev tooling (`CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/`, `.github/`) removed from `main` branch

## [1.0.0] — 2026-05-12

### First public release

**Auth & multi-user**
- Username + password authentication (Argon2id), session cookie `ff_session`
- Singleton installation per deployment; first user becomes owner automatically
- Owner approves pending registrations; roles: `owner`, `member`, `viewer`
- Household view (`default`) and personal view (`?view=mine`) scoped by `owner_user_id`

**Financial ledger**
- Assets: value, purchase price (cost basis Δ), liquidity flag, expected annual return, fixed + weighted contributions, weekly/monthly frequency
- Liabilities: principal (manual or derived from payment plan), APR, weekly/monthly payment schedule, auto-expiry
- Budget: persisted monthly income/expense lines; liability-derived debt payments included in snapshot
- Planning flows: upcoming one-off inflows and outflows with optional due dates
- Categories: CRUD per scope (asset, liability, income, expense)

**Analytics**
- Summary: net worth, total assets/liabilities, debt-to-assets ratio, financial health metrics (savings rate, runway, upcoming coverage), category and type-tag breakdowns
- Projection: monthly net-worth series via `futurefin-engine` (compound growth, debt service, asset contributions, planning cash adjustments, optional inflation deflation)
- FIRE / Jubilación tab: FIRE number modes (manual, annual expense × SWR, current income), capital-gains tax brackets, gap to target

**Infrastructure**
- Axum API, all routes under `/v1/`, OpenAPI at `/openapi.json`
- PostgreSQL + SQLx migrations (auto-run on startup)
- React + TypeScript + Vite SPA embedded in the Docker image
- Docker image: multi-arch (`linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64`), published to GHCR on `vX.Y.Z` tags
- NAS deploy: `docker-compose.yml`, imagen desde Docker Hub
- Backup: `GET /v1/backup/export.zip` (CSV ZIP, owner only)
